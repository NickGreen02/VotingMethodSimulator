# Voting Method Simulator
A lightweight Python program for simulating elections and facilitating comparison between Plurality, Condorcet, Borda Count and IRV voting methods.

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.11
2. Plotly Python graphing library - install using ```pip install plotly```
3. NumPy Python library - install using ```pip install numpy```

## Usage
To run the program, if open with Python is your system's default for .py files, double click VotingMethodSimulator.py. Otherwise, right click VotingMethodSimulator.py > Open with > Python.

The program allows the user to select from its main menu to 
1. Generate election data and a disagreement table
2. Use an existing folder of election data and generate a disagreement table
3. Use a single file of election data and output the results using each of the four included voting methods

Also included is testballots.txt, a text file with 50 ballots of 4 candidates each. This is an example election data file, in the correct format, that can be used with option 3.
